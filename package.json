  "description": "To support the travelling needs of our users we have around 35,000 tours live on our website exposed through various page types, such as a Tour Detail Page (TDP) or Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). For this test case you will focus on a sample SERP page that lists our tours for Europe, which is our highest traffic page. Therefore the page is highly optimised to bring the best experience to our users. This is made possible by taking various aspects into consideration during development process on day to day basis.",
